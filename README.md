# Music Store Database Project
This project focuses on the creation of a Music Store Database consisting of 13 different tables that are linked together. The database aims to simulate a music store's operations and provides a platform to analyze various aspects of the business.

## Project Description
The Music Store Database project is designed to mimic a real-world scenario of managing a music store's data. The database contains 13 interconnected tables, each representing different entities within the music store ecosystem. These tables include:

1. genres
2. invoice
3. invoice_line
4. media_type
5. playlist
6. playlist_track
7. track
8. album
9. album2
10. artist
11. customer
12. employee
13. schema_diagram
    
The tables are linked through primary and foreign key relationships to maintain data integrity and enable efficient querying.

## Purpose of the Project
The main objectives of this project are:

To design and implement a relational database schema for a music store.
To populate the database with sample data representative of a music store's transactions and operations.
To provide SQL queries that answer common business questions and perform analysis on the music store data.
To showcase proficiency in SQL database design, querying, and data manipulation.

## Project Files
The project repository includes the following files:

music store data.zip: SQL script file containing the database schema creation and data insertion queries.
sql_solutions_music_store_database.sql: SQL file containing solutions to various questions and queries related to the music store database.

## README.md: The current file providing an overview of the project.
How to Use
To set up the Music Store Database and run the queries:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open a SQL client (such as MySQL Workbench, PostgreSQL, etc.).
Run the music_store_database.sql script to create the database schema and populate it with sample data.
Use the sql_solutions.sql file to execute SQL queries to answer specific questions about the music store.
